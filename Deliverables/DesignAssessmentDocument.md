# Design assessment


```
<The goal of this document is to analyse the structure of your project, compare it with the design delivered
on April 30, discuss whether the design could be improved>

# Levelized structure map
```
<Applying Structure 101 to your project, version to be delivered on june 4, produce the Levelized structure map,
with all elements explosed, all dependencies, NO tangles; and report it here as a picture>
